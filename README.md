Postify is  a web application project  and not currently build as an android or ios application. But as it is built with flutter as frontend, I can definitely launch it as android /ios app in future. The instructions to run it are as follows:

As this web app is not deployed, you have to follow certain steps to run it: 

Step 1:) Go inside the backend folder and run app.js file. You should make sure that this javascript is running. (Use play button in VS Code). This will serve as Backend Server.

Step 2:) Go Inside Frontend\project_hercules\build\web and Right click and choose open in terminal.

Step 3:) Inside the terminal write the command:  python -m http.server.

Step 4:) Open Google Chrome and go to http://localhost:8000 and you will see the website
